# Week Three Overview

The content this week was partially generated by OpenAI's May24 2023 version of ChatGPT. All code was then tested and verified to ensure proper presentation of each topic.

The `SOCR-HeightWeight.csv` data was originally sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/burnoutminer/heights-and-weights-dataset). Additionally, to aid in teaching students about correlation and causation, the [shark_attacks.csv](https://bookdown.org/animestina/intro_stats_rms/). Both data files are available in the `data` directory in the root of this repository.

The exercise files can be used if time allows. Each one contains a description of the task at hand. Solutions for these exercises will be provided at some point.
