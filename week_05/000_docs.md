# Week Five Overview

The content this week was partially generated by OpenAI's May24 2023 version of ChatGPT. All code was then tested and verified to ensure proper presentation of each topic.

The `kaggle_diabetes_dataset.csv` data was originally sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set?resource=download). This dataset was then segmented into several files and a few minor alterations were made to facilitate the application of data munging using R.

The goal this week is to start tying together some of the basic analysis strategies and extend them to analyze a fresh dataset. This analysis will then be added to a short report, giving the participants a chance to start integrating plots they have created and further their data analysis skills.
