# Week Six Overview

The content this week was partially generated by OpenAI's May24 2023 version of ChatGPT. All code was then tested and verified to ensure proper presentation of each topic.

The content this week was originally sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) to illustrate an example data analysis within Python. Data for this notebook is available in [data/house-prices-regression-techniques](../data/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/). Further content pertaining to R and the usage of RStudio was developed and presented by Dr. Rob Baker and will be added at a later time.
